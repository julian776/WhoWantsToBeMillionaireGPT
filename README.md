# Who Wants to Be a Millionaire

Game where questions are generated by ChatGPT. Please note that not every question can be rendered correctly, as the Artificial Intelligence might make mistakes and provide questions in an incorrect format, making them unable to load. Additionally, you can save or finalize your interaction, and each time the server reloads, your previous session will be restored.

# Info

* The "questions" folder directs to the questions repository. We request ChatGPT to provide a structured response in JSON format, including the question, answer, and possible answers. The prompt used to interact with ChatGPT is as follows: 

```JSON
Give me a random question. Just answer me a JSON with what I just explained to you. Don't greet me, don't thank me, don't say anything extra. Answer in Spanish.
Example: {
  "question": "What is the capital of France?",
  "answer": "b",
  "options": {
    "a": "London",
    "b": "Paris",
    "c": "Berlin",
    "d": "Madrid"
  }
}
```

* On save folder exists save.txt and has the information of games.
