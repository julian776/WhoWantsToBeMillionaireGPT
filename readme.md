# Sofka Challenge

1. Please before runs the programm you have to install the requirements on a venv in your sofka folder. You can find what you need on "requirements.txt".
2. The file to start the game is index.py
3. In app is all modules. Is organized in this way because is not a large project. I think it makes easy to evaluate.
4. The questions folder has all questions files(One per round), them are organized as: question?/a/b/c/d/correct_answer
5. On save are save.txt and legend.txt. save.txt has the information of unfinished games and legend.txt has the information of games with wrong answers and winners.
Both are organized as: user_name/round/cash
